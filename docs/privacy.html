      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Personal data</h2>
      <p>
        OptiSearch does <strong>not</strong> collect searching history, browser history, or any other personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        In future OptiSearch may collect browser version, platform name, display settings and user's OptiSearch settings
        (but never data which can help identify user). Such information could be needed for decision
        on implementing or removing features as well as finding bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will happen only with your permission.
      </p>

      <h2>Local Storage</h2>
      <p>
        OptiSearch uses Chrome (Chromium) or WebExtensions Storage Sync API for storing user's settings, as well as
        files
        (written by the developpers of the extension) fetched from
        <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Dj0ulo/">Github Gist</a> necessary
        for the extension to work.
      </p>

      <h2>Reliance on External Services</h2>

      <p>OptiSearch, Bing Chat (GPT-4) in Google, and Gemini next to Google results ("the Extensions") 
        rely on external services and libraries, including <a href="https://github.com/Glench/ExtPay">ExtPay.js</a>, which utilizes Stripe for 
        payment processing and PayPal for donation processing, to provide certain features and 
        functionalities, such as processing payments for premium memberships and accepting donations.
         Additionally, the Extensions integrate with third-party applications, including Bing Chat, ChatGPT, and Google Gemini, 
         to enhance their functionalities and user experiences. While we make every effort to ensure the smooth operation of the Extensions, 
         it is important to understand that we may not have full control over these external services, and they may be subject to changes, disruptions, or discontinuation by their respective providers.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to External Services</h2>

      <p>The providers of external services and libraries, including ExtPay.js, Stripe, and PayPal, 
        may update their services, change their policies, or cease to operate at any time without prior notice. 
        These changes may impact the functionality of the Extensions, including premium membership payment 
        processing, donation processing, and other related services. Similarly, third-party applications such as Bing Chat, ChatGPT, and Google Gemini may introduce updates or changes that affect the integration with the Extensions.
      </p>

      <h2>Liability and Continuity</h2>

      <p>We will strive to adapt to any changes or disruptions in external services, third-party applications, and payment processors to minimize any potential impact on the Extensions and its users. However, we cannot guarantee the uninterrupted availability or performance of these external services, payment processors, and third-party applications, and we shall not be held liable for any issues arising from such changes or disruptions.
      </p>

      <h2>User Responsibility</h2>

      <p>Users of the Extensions are responsible for reviewing the terms and policies of external services, such as Stripe and PayPal, and third-party applications, including Bing Chat, ChatGPT, and Google Gemini, that they interact with through the Extensions. Users should also ensure that they comply with the terms and conditions of these services and applications.
